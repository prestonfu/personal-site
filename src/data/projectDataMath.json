      "We introduce Lie theory through the special case of matrix Lie groups. In doing so, we omit the topology that is essential to a more general study of Lie theory. In section 2, we introduce the notion of a matrix Lie group along with several basic definitions and properties of matrices. Section 3 defines and details matrix exponentiation; in section 4, we discuss tangent spaces and the Lie bracket, and in section 5 their connections to Lie algebras.",
